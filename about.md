<span class = "initial">"P</span>eter is a Singaporean enjoying a sojourn in New York City with his lovely wife and two beautiful daughters. He had served in the Singapore Navy for over 11 years, holding various positions. His last position being an operations officer aboard a stealth frigate. Early in his years of service, he had the good fortune of receiving a full overseas scholarship, which enabled him to spend 3 years in London pursing an Electrical and Electronic Engineering degree from Imperial college and another year in Stanford University for a Master degree in Management Science and Engineering.

Beyond military operations and planning, Peter also served concurrently in several naval working groups such as training, human resource, weapon expert panels and capability development, to solve problems and increase warfighting capabilities (which, he has since learnt, is called "productivity" in the real-world).

Peter left the navy in pursuit of entrepreneurship in the retail food industry in Singapore. He co-founded and managed a brand of retail confectionery shops and in two years, expanded to three retail stores and a 2,500 sqft central production facility moving into frozen confectionery manufacturing, supplying to the hospitality industry.

Two years into entreprenuership, when an opportunity came knocking for his family, he dropped everything and came to New York City to begin a much-envied new life as a stay-home-dad: sipping coffee at Starbucks and pondering about life. While not doing the laundry or tying pony-tails, Peter explored numerous fields including finance, management consulting and FOREX trading, took the Chartered Financial Analyst and Financial Risk Management series of exams, before finally finding his passion in Data Science.

Peter is currently enrolled in a Data Science Immersive bootcamp in General Assembly (NYC) while concurrently pursuing a Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity. He plans to further deepen his knowledge and skills in Data Science and Machine Learning before returning to Singapore to seek a career in the Data Science community in June 2017.

Peter's family is huge part of his life, but in whatever snippets of free time he has left, he loves to run and road-cycle. He also indulges himself in the love/hate relationship with Arsenal football team and suffers from severe withdrawal symptoms over the summers (except for even years when Euros and World Cups can help fill some of the void).

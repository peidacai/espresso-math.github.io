## General Assembly (NYC) Data Science Immersive Bootcamp Sep-Dec 2016

## Project02: 2000 Billboard Top 100 songs
We were provided with a dataset consisting of 2000 Billboard chart Top 100 songs.

##### Required tasks:

- Include a problem statement
- State the risks and assumptions of the data
- Import data using the Pandas library
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Use Tableau and/or Python plotting modules to visualize data
- Observe correlations in the data
- Evaluate a hypothesis
- Present results in a polished companion blog post of at least 500 words (& 1-2 graphics!)

### Approach to project

## 2. Problem statement(s)

My approach to creating problem statements is to adopt an industry-profitability view. To put myself in the shoes of someone in the music industry who are looking for songs that maximises profitability. 

With this as a basis, and since this is already a Top100 dataset, the problem identification portion can be distilled to two main factors:

1. Position on chart

2. Duration on chart

*$$We\ want\ Top100\ songs\ that\ stay\ high\ on\ the\ charts\ for\ a\ long\ time!$$*

#### Identify the problem(s)



#### Data acquisition



#### Parsing the data



#### Mine the data



#### Refine the data



#### Build a data model



#### Present results

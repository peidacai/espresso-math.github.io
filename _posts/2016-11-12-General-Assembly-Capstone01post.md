### Capstone Project: Introduction / Webscrapping

This week, in place of the weekly project, we began our journey into our capstone projects.

My chosen project is "Predicting NYC retail rental prices with taxi data".

### Aim / Impetus

I knew I wanted to do a project with geospatial data, however, after discussions with the bootcamp instructors, most geospatial analyses by themselves involves descriptive projects as opposed to predictive modelling. Therefore, in order to fulfil the bootcamp requirement, I had to find a way to marry the geospatial data with a predictive model.

From my experience in the retail food and beverage industry, I found the inspiration for my capstone projects. In my previous life, I had the opportunity to launch 3 food retail stores in Singapore. And like all other retail business, location of stores ranked high in the priority. However, many times, I found information lacking on the potential locations. Specifically, information on potential customer reach of the locations such as estimate of customer footcount, customer demographics, etc.

Therefore, I started looking around at data science projects which dealt with geospatial data in NYC and stumbled upon this [brilliant blog](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/) by Todd W. Schneider. In his blog, Todd worked with over 1.1 billion rows of taxi and uber trip data with some breathe-taking visualizations! I was so inspired to attempt something like this before I realized that the size of the data he worked with was over 3.3 gigabytes! There was no way my aging MacBook Air with a measly 4GB RAM will be able to take such a beating. I had to think of a way to work around this. More on this in subsequent post!

### Retail rental data

Now that I had a clear direction, I had to start gathering the data. As mentioned, I faced a significant road block when trying to get taxi data, so I decided to put that aside for now and focus on gathering the rental data. I did a quick search for online resources of commercial rental properties in NYC and found one that was very promising.

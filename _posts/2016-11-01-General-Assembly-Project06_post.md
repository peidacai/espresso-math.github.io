### Project06: Predicting movie ratings for top 250 all-time favorites

### 1. Introduction / Storyline

In this project, we pretended to be hired by Netflix to work with movie data, to try and figure out the factors which determined the IMDB movie ratings for top movies of all time. 

Here, we explored ensemble modelling, use of APIs and natural language processing.

#### Problem statement:

- To determine the most influential factors which determine IMDB ratings of a mmovie

### 2. Data exploration

Data from top 250 movies was obtained using the [IMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/), prominent features include: actors, title, awards, director and plot.

Original data from API:
- Columns: 20
- Rows: 250

Supplementary data (scraped from IMDB website):
- USA box office gross revenue
- Sound technology used in movie

#### a. Risks and assumptions of data

- 250 movies may not be large enough dataset to properly train a model to predict IMDB ratings. More movies should be obtained to create a better model.
